<p><strong>Detailed</strong></p>
<p>Said Mohamed (henceforth referred as "We", "Our" or "Us") built the Sunnah Assistant app as an
    ad-supported app. This App is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is. </p>
<p>This page is used to inform our app users regarding our policies with the collection and use of
    anonymous information if anyone decided to use our app. </p>
<p>If you choose to use our app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
    to this policy. The anonymous information that we collect is used for improving the app. We will
    not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>Information you add when creating To-Dos will be retained on your device and is not collected by
    us in any way. </p>
<p>If you enable automatic prayer time alerts and provide a city/town name the app uses Geocoding
    Api by Google Maps to determine latitude and longitude of the city/town provided (used in
    calculating prayer times). The use of this is subject to <a
            href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a
            href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms">Google Terms of Service</a>. </p>
<p>If you enable sharing anonymous usage data with us, that data will be used to improve the app.
    For example we can use that anonymous data to know which features are used the most or used the
    least and from that anonymous data we can know where to focus our development efforts.</p>
<p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. Link to
    privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app </p>
